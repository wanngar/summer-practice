<p>Among the different types of marine pollution, oil is a major threat to the sea ecosystems. The source of the oil pollution can be located on the mainland or directly at sea. Sea-based sources are discharges coming from ships or offshore platforms. Oil pollution from sea-based sources can be accidental or deliberate. Fortunately, the number of marine accidents and the volume of oil released accidentally are on the decline. On the other side, routine tanker operations can lead still to the release of oily ballast water and tank washing residues. Furthermore, fuel oil sludge, engine room wastes and foul bilge water produced by all type of ships, also end up in the sea. In the last decade maritime transportation has been growing steadily. More ships also increase the potential number of illegal oil discharges. Both oil tankers and other kinds of ships are among the suspected offenders of illegal discharges.
The different tools to detect and monitor oil spills are vessels, airplanes, and satellites. Vessels, especially if equipped with specialised radars, can detect oil at sea but they can cover a very limited area. The vessel, however, remains necessary in case oil sampling is required. The main systems to monitor sea-based oil pollution are the use of airplanes and satellites equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). SAR is an active microwave sensor, which captures two dimensional images. The brightness of the captured image is a reflection of the properties of the target-surface. The possibility of detecting an oil spill in a SAR image relies on the fact that the oil film decreases the backscattering of the sea surface resulting in a dark formation that contrasts with the brightness of the surrounding spill-free sea. Spaceborne SAR sensors are extensively used for the detection of oil spills in the marine environment, as they are independent from sun light, they are not affected by cloudiness, they cover large areas and are more cost-effective than air patrolling.</p>
